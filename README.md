# Latin N-Gram Viewer

Latin N-gram Viewer is a simple web application to **search n-grams** within a selected corpus of **ancient Latin texts** and **visualize their frequency**.

Using a simple and intuitive user interface, the chosen n-grams can be typed as text strings into a search bar. As a result, a graph is returned, which shows, alternatively, the absolute or relative frequency of the n-grams within the reference corpus and in relation to the time span defined by the corpus itself.

The application also allows the **search of multiple n-grams in parallel** and then the simultaneous comparison of the results. Furthermore, in the case of an absolute frequency of the n-gram other than zero, a table is associated with each individual historical epoch in the corpus, providing the number of occurrences of the same n-gram by text source.

The Latin texts data are originally taken from the [Perseus Digital Library](https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/) online project.
